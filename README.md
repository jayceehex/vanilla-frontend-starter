# Vanilla Front-end Starter üç¶

---

This is my personal starter for developing quick little front-end projects using HTML and CSS with minimal JS.

## Styles

---

The styling in this starter assumes the user device is a mobile device and is not using any assistive technology. Other cases are handled with mixins.

## How to use

---

Develop with hot reloading by running `npm run develop`.

Build using `npm run build`.

## Acknowledgments
